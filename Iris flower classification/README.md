Iris Flower Classification Project
This project involves building a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used in this project is the well-known Iris dataset, which is often used as a beginnerâ€™s dataset for classification tasks.

Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict the species of an Iris flower given its four features:

Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The model is trained using the Random Forest Classifier, an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve classification accuracy.

Dataset
The Iris dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with the following characteristics:

Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width (continuous numerical data).
Target labels: The flower species, which can be one of the following:
Setosa
Versicolor
Virginica
Each flower species is represented by 50 samples, and the dataset is balanced, meaning that each species has an equal number of samples.

Approach
Data Preprocessing:
The dataset is first cleaned and split into features (X) and target labels (y). The features are then standardized using StandardScaler to ensure that all measurements are on the same scale.

Model Training:
A Random Forest Classifier is trained on the training data. The Random Forest model is an ensemble method that uses multiple decision trees to make predictions, which improves accuracy and generalizes better on unseen data.

Model Evaluation:
The model is evaluated on the test dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, the confusion matrix is used to visualize the performance of the model in classifying each species.

Visualization:
Visualizations are provided for:

Confusion Matrix: A heatmap showing how well the model performs by comparing predicted labels to true labels.
Feature Importance: A bar chart showing the importance of each feature in making predictions.
Technologies Used
Python
pandas: For data manipulation and CSV file handling.
numpy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For visualizing data and evaluation results.
scikit-learn: For building and evaluating the machine learning model (including preprocessing, classification, and evaluation).
